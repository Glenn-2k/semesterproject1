                <p class="involved-text"> Step into the magical universe of 'The Sky Above Us', where stars twinkle like
                    diamonds, planets dance in space, and galaxies stretch out like cosmic paintings. Are you ready for
                    an adventure that will take you from the Earth to the farthest reaches of space?</p>
                <p class="involved-text">Imagine looking up at the night sky and finding pictures in the stars. That's
                    what 'The Sky Above Us' is all about! It's like connecting the dots in a gigantic cosmic coloring
                    book. As you walk through the exhibition, you'll meet brave heroes and mythical creatures in the
                    form of constellations. These starry stories have been told by people all around the world for ages!

                <p class="involved-text">Those tiny points of light in the sky are not just stars. They're whole
                    galaxies, each one a city of stars just like ours. You'll feel like a space traveler as you visit
                    these distant galaxies and see how vast our universe truly is. It's like exploring a never-ending
                    space playground!</p>
                <p class="involved-text">But that's not all. </p>
                <p class="involved-text">Did you know that long ago, before GPS or maps, people used the stars to find
                    their way? Imagine sailing on a huge ocean and looking up at the stars to steer your ship.
                    In 'The Sky Above Us', you'll learn about these smart navigators and how they used the stars to
                    guide their adventures.</p>

                <p class="involved-text">You'll join a team of space travelers and robot explorers as they blast off to
                    visit our planetary neighbors. From speedy Mercury to icy Pluto (which isn't a planet anymore, but
                    it's still really cool!), you'll learn fun facts about each one. What's the weather like on Venus?
                    Can it rain diamonds on Neptune? </p>
                <p class="involved-text">Let's find out together!</p>
                <p class="involved-text">'The Sky Above Us' is your ticket to a world of wonder, where stars tell
                    stories, planets reveal secrets, and the universe becomes your playground. So put on your space
                    helmets and get ready to explore galaxies, meet ancient heroes, and discover the mysteries of the
                    cosmos. Your cosmic adventure starts now!</p>
